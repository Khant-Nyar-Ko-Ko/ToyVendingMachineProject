        {` Happy Birthday, Poe! Now, you are 22. I am sure you've gone through a
        lot in your 21 years. I know that you are trying to do your best. And I
        know that you did it well. Congratulations for that! In your 22 years, I
        hope you can accomplish your goals ASAP and do everything you want. You
        are the strongest girl that I've ever seen. Your family will definitely
        be proud of you and what you are doing right now, my strong girl. One of
        the things I'm trying to learn from you is your strength. Thank you for
        choosing me and guiding me throughout these years. You were a great help
        to me. I might not have done well if you hadn't been there for me. Thank
        you for your love and understanding. I can truly understand what love is
        because of you. I'm excited to see what kinds of obstacles 
         we'll have to confront together. I vow to go over everything with you
         while holding your tiny little hands.
